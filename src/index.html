<h3>I may seem like a slight n00b, but once I get going you'll see my gear is epic!</h3>
<p>I am a budding Front-end Developer with experience in freenlancing as well as working for a software company. I have an AAIT in Web Design and a BSB in Digital Marketing. I absolutely love code (it just makes so much SENSE and it's all orderly), and am happiest at work when at least one of my screens has code on it. I constantly strive to not only stay current on standards, but to also branch out to learn new languages and programs to use them in.</p>
